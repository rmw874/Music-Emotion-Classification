Programming Language Design (tilbydes af KU)

The course explores the design space of programming languages and how the design choices affect the implementation and other properties of the language.
A brief history of programming languages is presented and a selected set of features are explored with respect to design choices, how they interact and how they can be implemented.
The aim is to give the student an understanding of the programming-language landscape that will both be helpful when the student designs and implements programming languages but also to better understand existing programming languages.
There will be some programming in languages very different from what most students have experienced, including variants of LISP and Prolog.
